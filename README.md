### FAI Homework
The instructions of each homework are as follows.
- hw1: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~stchen/teaching/fai24/hw1/hw1.html
- hw2: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~stchen/teaching/fai24/hw2/hw2.html
- hw3: Implement the following essential parts of basic machine learning
  - Preprocessing: Implement feature scaling: normalize or standardize features
  - Models
    - Implement a linear model (logistic regression for classification, linear regression for regression).
    - Implement a nonlinear model (decision tree for classification, decision tree for regression).
    - Implement a random forest model for classification and regression).
  - Training
    - Implement gradient descent for logistic and linear regression.
    - Implement a basic algorithm for building a decision tree.
    - Implement a basic algorithm for building a random forest.
  - Evaluation: Implement evaluation metrics: accuracy for classification, mean squared error (MSE) for regression.
- hw4: Implement Principal Component Analysis, Autoencoder, and Denoising Autoencoder

### FAI Final Project
The final project requires students to implement Texas Holdâ€™em AI to compete in the casino of the class, formed by baseline AIs and other AI players implemented by classmates.
